            <ol>
                <li> On the next page, you will be shown 10 pieces of text that come from a single person's public Twitter account. 
                    In bold, before each piece of text, we describe what kind of text it is. There is a short guide below.
                  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Tweet: A tweet is something that user typed and posted directly onto their public Twitter account for others to see.</li>
                    <li>Retweet: A retweet is something that was originally posted by <b>someone other than the user</b>, but that the user wanted to share on their public Twitter account.</li>
                    <li>Quote: A quote is the same as a retweet and is shared on the user's public Twitter account, <b>but the user has the ability to add a short comment with their own perspective.</b></li>
                    <li>Reply: A reply is a user's response directly to another Tweet. Replies are also posted on the user's public Twitter account.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>


                <li>Please read each piece of text carefully, and when you are done, make a judgement about the user's political party affiliation at the bottom of the page, 
                    then press Submit. It is okay to say "I can't tell".
                </li>


                <li>You will repeat this process 5 times before seeing the "Thank you for Submitting" page. 
                    Please click the button there to finalize your submission.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you would like to participate again, you can re-click the link that you used to participate in the first place.
                </li>

                <li>
                    When you are ready to begin, please enter your participant ID in the box on the right hand side of the screen. 
                    If you are a Prolific or MTurk worker, this is your worker ID. 
                    If you are a research assistant, you can just put your first name followed by the first letter of your last name. Then, press "Enter".
